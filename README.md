# Tree Emoji CLI

List contents of directories in tree-like 🌳 format with Emojis 📁📄🖼️

Tree-emoji-cli is a recursive directory listing program that produces a depth indented listing of files. With no arguments, tree lists the files in the current directory. When directory arguments are given, tree lists all the files and/or directories found in the given directories each in turn with emojis. Upon completion of listing all files/directories found, tree returns the total number of files and/or directories listed.

## Example

Command:

```
tree -l 2 -o output.txt
```

Result:

```

## Install

```
npm install -g tree-emoji-cli
```

## Usage

use the command `tree` or `treee` (to avoid confliction with system command)

**NOTE: use `treee` instead of `tree` on windows system.**

``
tree/treee
``

#### Use --help to list help info.

``
tree --help
``

#### Specify the level of path (how deep to scan).

use `-l levelNumber` to specify the path level.

```
tree -l 2
```

#### Output result to a file

use `-o outputFilePath` to specify the output file.

```
tree -l 2 -o out.txt
```

#### Show directory only

use `-d` to show directories only.

```
tree -l 2 -o out.txt -d
```

#### Other arguments

see [Options](#options).

#### FOR WINDOWS USERS

you should just use the `treee` command as `tree` has been already taken by windows system.

```
treee -l 2 -o out.txt -d
```

## Options

* --help: outputs a verbose usage listing.
* --version: outputs the version of tree-emoji-cli.
* --debug: show debug info.
* --fullpath: prints the full path prefix for each file.
* --ignore: ignores directory or file you specify - accepts arrays as comma-delimited strings: `'node_modules/, .git/, .gitignore'`
* --link: follows symbolic links if they point to directories, as if they were directories. Symbolic links that will result in recursion are avoided when detected.
* --noreport: omits printing of the file and directory report at the end of the tree listing and omits printing the tree on console.
* -a: all files are printed. By default tree does not print hidden files (those beginning with a dot '.'). In no event does tree print the file system constructs '.' (current directory) and '..' (previous directory).
* -d: list directories only.
* -f: append a '/' for directories, a '=' for socket files and a '|' for FIFOs.
* -i: makes tree not print the indentation lines, useful when used in conjunction with the -f option.
* -l: max display depth of the directory tree.
* -o: send output to filename.
